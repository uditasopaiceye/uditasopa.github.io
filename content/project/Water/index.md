InSAR has been our trusted companion in monitoring surface movements linked to tectonic processes since the landmark 1992 Landers Earthquake. With the support of the latest and upcoming SAR constellations, we're now in a position to detect even the subtlest shifts in Earth's movements. I've always been deeply fascinated by the tectonic dances of our planet.

Together with my wonderful collaborators, we've delved into:

(1) Cascadia Slow Slip Events - InSAR has proven to be a stellar tool, beautifully complementing GPS measurements.

(2) Galapagos Sierra Negra - Our study on trapdoor faulting has been pivotal in constraining the absolute chamber volume.

(3) Hawaii Kilauea post-2018 Caldera Collapse - A blended approach of InSAR and GPS measurements has been invaluable in uncovering the mysteries of Kilauea's magmatic system.
