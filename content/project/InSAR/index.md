Isn‚Äôt it fascinating how Earth observation technologies are continually enhancing our ability to analyze and interpret the planet's dynamics? Among these, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) stands out as a remarkably powerful technique. It enables the detection of minute surface displacements with centimeter- to millimeter-level accuracy across extensive areas, making it a vital tool for monitoring natural hazards, infrastructure stability, and environmental changes.

My interest lies in leveraging SAR data, particularly interferometric SAR, to uncover the subtle movements and transformations occurring on Earth's surface. My work in InSAR has involved both the analytical interpretation of methodologies and their application to a range of practical, real-world challenges.
