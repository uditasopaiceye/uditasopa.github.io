## Rapid Structural Damage Mapping During Wildfire Events

At ICEYE, I helped advance the Wildfire Insights solution by applying SAR remote sensing and geospatial science expertise to develop building-level damage detection tools. This solution supports insurers with verified damage data within 24 hours of wildfire impact—independent of weather or daylight conditions.

Using ICEYE’s X-band SAR constellation, I worked on SAR-based change detection techniques to identify structural loss across fire-affected zones. My contributions included algorithm tuning for urban infrastructure detection, post-classification processing, and integrating the results with geospatial vector formats for seamless decision support.

## My Contributions:
- Built SAR-based workflows for detecting and classifying structural loss in wildfire zones.
- Helped calibrate damage detection thresholds across diverse terrains and settlement types.
- Delivered vector-based outputs (point and polygon layers) for operational insurance workflows.
- Collaborated on integrating outputs into Esri-based dashboards for real-time situational awareness.

## Product Features:
- **Building-level binary classification** of 'destroyed' vs. 'undamaged' within hours of fire containment.
- **Actionable vector outputs** ready for ingestion by GIS teams and insurers.
- **ESRI wildfire monitoring dashboard** combining SAR results, fire perimeters, hotspots, and urban exposure layers.
- **Consistent insights** across multiple wildfire events regardless of smoke or cloud cover.

ICEYE’s Wildfire Insights enables insurers and emergency response teams to make timely, data-driven decisions without waiting for aerial or optical validation.
