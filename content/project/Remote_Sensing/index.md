title: Remote Sensing Applications
summary: I’ve applied remote sensing techniques across a wide range of environmental monitoring projects, from assessing urban heat islands and mapping volcanic deformation with InSAR, to modeling forest structures using LiDAR and developing web-based applications on Google Earth Engine. My work integrates multi-sensor datasets, geospatial analytics, and field validation to produce actionable insights for climate, disaster, and land surface studies.

Advances in Earth observation tools have empowered researchers to address a wide spectrum of environmental and geophysical challenges. My remote sensing journey has encompassed diverse geospatial applications that integrate multi-sensor data, image processing workflows, and field-based validation to better understand dynamic Earth systems.
One area of focus has been urban climate analysis, where I assessed the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) changes and the urban heat island (UHI) effect in Jaipur, India. By analyzing decadal satellite data from 2009 to 2019, I quantified thermal patterns associated with urban expansion and their implications for sustainable city planning.
In the domain of volcanic hazard monitoring, I independently processed Sentinel-1 SAR data to map surface deformation caused by the Taal volcano eruption. This involved generating RTC backscatter images and LOS interferograms to assess displacement magnitude and direction, demonstrating the utility of InSAR for disaster response and risk evaluation.

My work on cryospheric mapping involved classifying SAR data from Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT to identify surface features in polar regions like Greenland and Svalbard. I supported this with fieldwork in the Indian Himalayas, collecting snow parameters to improve satellite-based model validation and geophysical interpretations under extreme conditions.
For forest structure analysis, I participated in a hackathon where I modeled canopy height and terrain using airborne LiDAR point clouds. I derived 3D structural layers and canopy metrics through integrated LiDAR and high-resolution DEM processing, facilitating forest monitoring and ecological studies.

Lastly, I developed multiple environmental monitoring tools using Google Earth Engine. These web apps leveraged Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat, and MODIS data for applications such as oil spill detection, forest cover change, and temperature anomaly mapping. They incorporated interactive dashboards and real-time visualization, supporting both scientific research and public awareness.

Together, these projects showcase a multi-disciplinary approach to solving complex Earth science problems using remote sensing, spatial analytics, and advanced modeling techniques.
