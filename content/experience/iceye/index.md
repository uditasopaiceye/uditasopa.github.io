## **Geospatial Intelligence for Rapid Disaster Response**
As a remote sensing and geospatial specialist at ICEYE, I worked across two of the company’s flagship catastrophe response solutions—Hurricane Rapid Impact and Wildfire Insights. These products enable insurance and emergency response sectors to detect, assess, and act on disaster impact within hours using ICEYE’s proprietary SAR satellite constellation.

In both projects, I delivered high-resolution raster-based geospatial insights, designed and executed change detection workflows, and generated scalable hexgrid summaries for real-time situational awareness.

### 🌪️ Hurricane Rapid Impact
In the Hurricane product, I built raster processing chains that translated raw multi-temporal SAR data into wind-induced damage footprints. These outputs were used to triage claims, assess building damage, and direct emergency responders during critical post-landfall hours.

#### My Contributions:
* **SAR-based Raster Workflows**: Developed and optimized multi-temporal raster analytics to detect structural changes in hurricane paths at 30 m resolution.
* **Hexgrid-Based Summaries**: Aggregated spatial damage estimates into hexgrids to support scalable risk assessments and GIS integration.
* **Disaster Data Pipelines**: Collaborated with cross-functional teams to automate raster product delivery, reducing time-to-insight for operational users

### 🔥 Wildfire Insights
For ICEYE’s wildfire product, I contributed to near real-time building-level damage classification by integrating SAR-based change detection with structural footprint databases. This helped insurers identify destroyed or undamaged structures even in areas obscured by smoke or cloud cover.

#### My Contributions
* **Binary Structural Classification**: Supported modeling of destroyed vs. undamaged structures within fire perimeters using SAR-based raster maps.
* **Quality Control Pipelines**: Refined damage detection algorithms to ensure high accuracy and reduce false positives.
* **Spatial Analytics Integration**: Delivered clean geospatial outputs compatible with Esri-based dashboards and insurance risk models.

## **Cross-Domain Impact**

This experience strengthened my expertise in:

* **Remote Sensing & SAR Analytics**: From raw image calibration to thematic product generation.
* **GIS & Spatial Data Engineering**: Raster tiling, hexgrid binning, and vector-raster fusion.
* **Data Science for Earth Observation**: Structuring, automating, and scaling geospatial data pipelines for real-world use cases.

Whether for disaster response or broader EO applications, my work demonstrates the ability to derive actionable insights from complex SAR datasets and transform them into deployable products that inform decisions at scale.
