abstract: The magma chamber volume is critical for volcano hazards assessment and forecasting. Standard geodetic methods cannot constrain the total volume, only the volume change. Here, we show that the deformation response of the magma chamber to trapdoor faulting earthquakes in the Sierra Negra volcano, Galapagos, depends on both the absolute chamber volume and the compressibility of the magma. Bubble-free magma provides the lower limit on compressibility and an upper bound on the chamber volume of 13.6 to 20.6 km3, depending on fault dip. We estimate an upper limit on compressibility using a conduit model relating volatile content to lava fountain height, compared with observations from the 2005 eruption, constrained by volatile content of olivine melt inclusions. This yields a lower bound on chamber volume of half the upper bound. We find that the best fitting trapdoor faults are near vertical and dip steeply to the north (88 degrees).
