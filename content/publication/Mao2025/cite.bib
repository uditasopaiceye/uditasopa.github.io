abstract = {In early 2023, a series of intense atmospheric-river storms eased California’s historic drought, yet the spatiotemporal extent of groundwater recovery remains poorly understood. We tracked two-decadal changes in groundwater in Greater Los Angeles using seismic ambient-field interferometry. The derived seismic hydrographs reveal distinct expressions of groundwater and surficial water droughts: Whereas surface and near-surface water storage nearly fully recovered in the epic wet season of 2023, only about 25\% of the groundwater lost since 2006 was restored. On a decadal scale, we find substantial depletion in aquifers below 50-meter depth, with only limited storm-related recovery. Our analysis underscores the need to monitor deep aquifers for a more complete assessment of total water deficits, using high-resolution tools such as seismic sensing. Atmospheric river storms in California have helped replenish surface reservoirs. The amount of water going to groundwater reservoirs is far less clear, in part because this volume is difficult to measure. Mao et al. showed that seismic ambient field interferometry could be used in the greater Los Angeles area to track groundwater (see the Perspective by Taira and Bürgmann). The authors found that only about 25\% of the groundwater lost since 2006 was replenished by a very wet 2023. These observations highlight the need for more continuous monitoring and provide a different way to estimate groundwater resources. —Brent Grocholski}}
