abstract:  In this research paper, focus is given on exploring the potential of Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) technique for the measurement of landslide, which is the extension of existing DInSAR technique. In PSInSAR technique, the movement is measured by finding the phase shift in the scatterers present in the study area through the course of time. The backscattering of such a scatterer does not change during the study. By using this technique, 32 datasets acquired over a period of time i.e. from 2009 to 2011 over the area of Troms County of Lyngen Fjord, Norway are analysed. The dataset utilised are acquired with TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X pair, in Stripmap mode of acquisition. Coregistration of dataset with subpixel accuracy is done with master images is done to align all the dataset correctly. APS estimation is done in order to remove the phase decorrelation caused by the atmosphere, movement, etc. using algorithms for phase unwrapping which allowed the processing of sparse data and the effect of atmosphere is reduced by doing analysis on temporal basis of the phase shift in interferograms of successive datasets. By this study it has been tried to show the estimation of shift can be done by the temporal analysis of the data acquired by TerraSAR-X. The velocity output is displayed in a map reflecting the velocity of movement. Apart from this, the data properties such as baseline distribution both temporal and spatial are displayed in a chart. Other outputs obtained are the atmospheric Phase Screen, sparse point distribution, reflectivity map of the study area etc. are displayed using a map of terrain. The output velocity obtained of the terrain movement is found to be in the range of −40 mm/yr to −70 mm/yr.
